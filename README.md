# Image_Classifier_Project_CNN_deepLearning_model
"Image Classification of cats and dogs using CNN"

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the popular Cats vs Dogs dataset and deployed using Gradio for a simple and interactive GUI.

🎯 Objectives

Build a CNN model for binary image classification (cats vs dogs).

Train, validate, and test the model using 64×64 images.

Deploy the trained model with Gradio for real-time predictions.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Gradio (for GUI deployment)

Google Colab (training environment)

📊 Dataset

Dataset Source: Kaggle Cats vs Dogs

Preprocessed into 64×64 images for CNN input.


🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Colab:
Run in Colab


2. Mount Google Drive and load the dataset.


3. Train the CNN model or load the saved model (cat_dog_model.h5).


4. Run the Gradio interface cell to test with your own images.


📌 Results

Achieved ~90% accuracy on validation set.

Successfully distinguishes cats vs dogs with good generalization.


🌍 Real-World Applications

Pet recognition in photo apps.

Veterinary diagnostics (basic animal ID).

Security systems for detecting pets in camera feeds.
